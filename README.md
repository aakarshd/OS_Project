# OS_Project

This repository contains documentation of modified xv6 files which are worked upon by Subhash and myself, as a part of the requirements of the Operating Systems course, which we are pursuing in our 5th semester.

The files include headers and code written in C to implement and add new functionality namely the waitpid() syscall to the opensource xv6 OS, and as a part of our project we have updated various files (the list of which you will find below). 

1) syscall.h
2) defs.h
3) user.h
4) sysproc.c
5) usys.S
6) syscall.c
7) proc.c
8) ps.c

The reader/learner is encouraged to use/modify files like checkwaitpid.c which test the implementation of waitpid in xv6. We have made sure that all the three levels of problem statement(also included in repository) are met.

We hope you have fun and learn something from our contribution. If you find something unclear, please don't hesitate to reach us at :
